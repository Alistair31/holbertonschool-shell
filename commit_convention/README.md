COMMIT CONVENTION  
  

1-INTRODUCTION  
  
When you commit anything into your GitHub, you have to respect a certain way of describing what you did.  
Those conventions have been established to organise, with your commit message, in a log of every modification on your repository.  
The commit message have to be written as such : [type]: (message)
  
2-COMMIT TYPES  
  
There are several types of commit message, right now you primarly going to use those :  
        [feat:] - when you want to introduce a new feature (new file/function/script... )  
        [fix:] - when you want to fix an already existing feature (one previously introduced by "feat:" )  
        [docs] - when you want to write or update a document (README for exemple )  
  
3-COMMIT MESSAGE  
  
Your message have to contain a short description of what you did.  
If you introduce a new feature, write what function it has, if it is a fix, write any change that you did.  
It shouldn't be more than 70 characters for now so you will have to condense the information.
